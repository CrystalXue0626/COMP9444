We chose\nYOLOv8, the most recent iteration of the YOLO series, to conduct 2D\nobject detection for this project. Instead of a single model, YOLOv8 has\ncreated multiple versions, each with its own distinctive\ncharacteristics. Our project uses YOLOv8s. These version are:\n\n-   YOLOv8n ---- The nano version\n-   YOLOv8s ---- The small version\n-   YOLOv8m ---- The medium version\n-   YOLOv8l ---- The large version\n-   YOLOv8x ---- The extra-large version\n\nThe performance analysis of recent versions of YOLO is shown below: []\nrefer to https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics\n\nArchitecture of YOLOv8 is shown below: [] refer to\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics\n\nYOLOv8 Result\n\nSample output of YOLOv8 pretrained Model\n\n[]\n\nSample output YOLOv8 Trained on minidataset\n\n[]\n\nFrom sample output of pretrained model, YOLOv8 may not perform as well\nas some other algorithms in detecting small objects and dense object\nscenes. After training on minidataset, not only did the precision of\ndetecting nearest cars improve to 0.85, but it was also able to detect\ncars in the distance. However, it was unable to detect vehicles,\npresumably due to a lack of samples in the \"truck\" category.\n\nModel Result\n\nBased on the graph, we can see taht \"car\" has the highest precision,\nwhile \"bus\" and \"truck\" would be misdetected as \"car\". And most of them\nwould be misdetected as background.\n\n[]\n\nEpoch Training Steps\n\n[]\n\nYOLOv8 Discussion\n\nSystem Performance\n\nSystem Specifications: We have trained YOLOv8 model through Google Colab\nwith NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB\n\nDataset\n\nDue to time limit, we have used a mini-training dataset (2049 images)\nrandomly extracted from nuImages which are all from camera with 2D\nannotations.\n\nTraining Specifications\n\nTraining parameter have been pre-tuned by the developer:\n\n-   Optimizer: SGD(lr": null}
